	<p> Dear Future Employer,</p>
	
	<p> 
		I am writing to express my interest in the Web Development position at Imaginary Company. <br>
As a recent graduate of HSI Katy High School with a strong foundation in STEM, particularly <br>
physics and mathematics, and current studies in Computer Science at Western Governors University, <br>
I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and enthusiasm in a professional environment.
	</p>

	<p>
		In addition to my academic background, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through internships <br>
with Goodwill and Harmony Public Schools. At Goodwill, I developed a strong work ethic and <br>
attention to detail while sorting and organizing inventory. At Harmony Public Schools, I currently <br>
assist in classroom settings, support the GT program, and help with daily operations like lunch duty. <br>
These roles have taught me adaptability, teamwork, and responsibility. 
	</p>

	<p>
		I also hold a Google IT Support Certificate, which has enhanced my technical troubleshooting and <br>customer service abilities. My passion for technology, combined with my practical experience and <br>
determination to support my own education, make me a motivated and reliable candidate.
	</p>

	<p>
		I would be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to your team and grow within your company. <br>
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how <br>
I can support your goals.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sincerely,<br>
		Melih Yuksel
