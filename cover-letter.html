	<p>Dear Future Employer,</p>

	<article>
	<section>
	<p> 
		I am writing to express my interest in the <mark>Web Development</mark> position at Imaginary Company. <br>
		As a recent graduate of <mark>HSI Katy High School</mark> with a strong foundation in <mark>STEM</mark>, particularly <br>
		physics and mathematics, and current studies in Computer Science at <mark>Western Governors University</mark>, <br>
		I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and enthusiasm in a professional environment.
	</p>

	<section>
	<p>
		In addition to my academic background, Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience through internships <br>
		with <mark>Goodwill</mark> and <mark>Harmony Public Schools</mark>. At Goodwill, I developed a <mark>strong work ethic</mark> and <br>
		<mark>attention to detail</mark> while sorting and organizing inventory. At Harmony Public Schools, I currently <br>
		assist in <mark>classroom settings</mark>, support the <mark>GT program</mark>, and help with daily operations like <mark>lunch duty</mark>. <br>
		These roles have taught me <mark>adaptability, teamwork, and responsibility.</mark>
	</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	<p>
		I also hold a <mark>Google IT Support Certificate</mark>, which has enhanced my technical troubleshooting and <br>
		customer service abilities. My <mark>passion for technology</mark>, combined with my <mark>practical experience</mark> and <br>
		<mark>determination</mark> to support my own education, make me a motivated and reliable candidate.
	</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	<p>
		I would be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to your team and grow within your company. <br>
		Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how <br>
		I can support your goals.
